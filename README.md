# react-native-drillable-object-view

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/newtonry/react-native-drillable-object-view.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This component takes in an array or object and renders a view that you can drill down into, similar to what you can do in a Chrome debugger (see gif below).

## Installation
```npm install react-native-drillable-object-view``` or ```yarn add react-native-drillable-object-view```


## How to use
```js
import DrillableObjectView from 'react-native-drillable-object-view';

...

// example object
const person = {
  name: 'Homer',
  age: 39,
  enjoysBeer: true,
  children: [
    {
      name: 'Bart',
      age: 10,
      enjoysBeer: null,
      children: [],
    },
    {
      name: 'Lisa',
      age: 10,
      enjoysBeer: null,
    },
    {
      name: 'Maggie',
      age: 1.2,
      enjoysBeer: null,
    },
  ],
};

<DrillableObjectView
    autoExpandDepth={1}
    keyName={'parentKey'}
    marginLeft={10}
    value={person}
/>
```

### Props

```autoExpandDepth``` - How many levels of the object you want to be open when it's initially rendered. Default is 0, which means only the parent can be seen at the start.

```keyName``` - The key name that will be displayed. Only the initial keyName is relevant to you. Default is 'parent'.

```marginLeft``` - The margin between nested objects. Adjusting this may make it more or less readable for you. Default is 8.

```value``` - The array or object that you want to be rendered.

This is pretty basic at the moment, but if you have new features, requests, or would like to contribute feel free to open a PR and ping me!
I've created a pre-push hook that runs ```npm test``` and ```npm run lint``` prior to pushing. Please run these.
